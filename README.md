## How it works
An Instrumentation Amplifier (IA) is a circuit that can extract low-level low-frequency differential signals that are embedded in high-level common noise signals. This IA’s ability is due to the value of the Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) is very high; the CMRR must be grater than 120 dB.  So that, IAs are widely used in biomedical applications, specifically as an analog front-end for electrocardiogram (ECG) data acquisition.
Figure 1 shows how the designed IA must be connected as a 3 leads configuration to a human patient to obtain the unfiltered version of the ECG.
